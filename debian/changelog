  * Suggest fonts-linuxlibertine as an alternative to ttf-linux-libertine.
  * Update David Goodger's e-mail address in debian/copyright

    reStructuredText.
    + Remove docbook-to-man from Build-Depends-Indep.

  * Don't run dh_testroot in the clean target. There's a good chance that root
    privileges are not needed (e.g. because binary target was run under
    fakeroot), and even if they are actually needed, the target will fail
    quickly.

    + Conflict with previous versions python-docutils
    + /usr/share/doc/python-docutils/docs used to be a directory, but is now a

    + Build-depend on python3-all.
    + Add two patches to fix incompatibilities with Python 3.2
      (python3.2-configparser.diff, python3.2-elementtree.diff).
    + Both python-docutils and python3-docutils provides rst* scripts, managed
      by alternatives.
    + Conflict with other packages shipping /usr/bin/rst2* binaries, so that
      alternatives can be correctly installed. Add lintian override for

        (.. __target: URI) are no longer accepted
      * tools/editors/emacs/rst.el changed license to GPL

  * Migrate to new Python policy, and python-central (closes: #373529).
  * Remove circular dependency during policy migration (closes: #362172).
  * Install tools as e.g. /usr/bin/rst2html only - do not install any
    executables with a .py extension, as pycentral thinks it should
    byte-compile them. Also, Policy section 10.4.
    - Install buildhtml as /usr/bin/rst-buildhtml to avoid namespace pollution.
    - Don't install quicktest.py and the "dev" tools, which appear to be
      intended for docutils developers only.
  * Move some of the documentation from /usr/share/doc/python-docutils
    to /u/s/d/p-d/docs, and compile all the documentation to HTML,
    to avoid broken hyperlinks (closes: #312305).
    - In debian/rules, tell buildhtml.py to give us the full Python
